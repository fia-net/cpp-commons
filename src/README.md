# FIA-NET C++ components

This package contains some of the software we're using and developing daily at Fia-Net, for our
own products (Certissim, TULIPE). We started to build this component collection in 2008 and
since that time, we have been constantly adding and updating stuff. Time has come to share some
of our source code with the open-source community.
 
We wil be gradually adding components, but we need to make the source code readable (with 
comments in English).

# License
This software is licensed under the [Apache Licence v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

# Supported platforms
Our source code is known to work on Linux / x86, on 32 and 64 bit platforms. Until 2013, it
was also developed for Solaris 8 and 9 with Sparc CPUs.

# How to build
GNU make and GCC (4.4.7+) are required to build the current version.

Details about the whole process will be provided in later commits. For now, have a look at the config/config.mk file and try your luck with "make" in the top directory!

# Examples
There is no example code for now. But we try to provide unit tests in each library folder so you can have a glimpse of how to use the libs.

# Support
We do not provide support of any kind for now. But if you have any comment or question, feel free to contact us!
