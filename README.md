# FIA-NET cpp-commons

This is a set of C++ libraries developed at FIA-NET, mainly for
Certissim and TULIPE products.

They are the result of many days (and nights) of twisted thinking
and refactoring. We believe that they are useful enough to be shared 
with the open-source community.

## Supported platforms
Until 2013, this source code used to be compiled on Sparc under Solaris 8 and 9.
Since then we have switched to the x86 platform under CentOS Linux. It does 
compile on GCC 4.4.7. It may work with other platforms and/or compilers but
we do not provide any support on that.

## Contributing
This software package is provided "as-is". 
You can report bugs and issues on [github](https://github.com/fia-net/cpp-commons/issues)

## Licensing
Those libraries are released under the Apache 2.0 license.
